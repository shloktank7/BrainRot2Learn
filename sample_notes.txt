Machine Learning Exam 1 â€“ Study Notes

Supervised Learning:
- Maps inputs (features) to outputs (labels) with known ground truth.
- Common algorithms: Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVMs, kNN.
- Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC.

Unsupervised Learning:
- Finds structure in unlabeled data (clusters/dimensions).
- Algorithms: k-means, hierarchical clustering, PCA, t-SNE.
- Use cases: customer segmentation, anomaly detection, visualization.

Neural Networks:
- Layers of linear transforms + nonlinear activations.
- Training via backpropagation and gradient descent (SGD/Adam).
- Overfitting vs. generalization; use regularization & proper validation.

Responsible AI:
- Bias can appear via data, modeling choices, or deployment context.
- Mitigate with balanced datasets, careful evaluation, transparency.
- Privacy and security: protect data; consider adversarial robustness.

Exam Tips:
- Understand definitions and when to apply each method.
- Be able to read confusion matrices and compute precision/recall.
- Practice interpreting ROC curves and trade-offs.
